// running TODO

- puzzle solved dialog "New Game" button should be larger and more noticeable.

- update puzzle code to encode hints used and time taken and eventually be able to be loaded by clicking url.  Might need a different format without colon.  Anything else?
    - we don't necessarily need to use this information, but it'd be nice to have available for challenges

- Set up URL to be able to load game by clicking url:
    - ie rainboku.io/m0203352...

- award points based on difficulty, time, and hints used

- achievements
    - we need to code differently in order to track stats
    - app vs web
        - app: likely easier for persistence of settings
        - web: we'd need an account likely
